  ● added a current markers for node ~
    ● if for example a list of files like

    ----------- example.flux ---------------
      file a.txt
     >file b.txt # will be shown 1st
      file c.txt
      file d.txt
    ----------------------------------------

  ● make flux remember flux file structure ~
    ● save comments, block-brackets,tabs, and the
      positions of the blank lines.

      This will provide the tools necessary for a more efficient
      nvpm#edit. It would edit the data structure instead of the 
      file itself. Then, on leaving nvim, this DS would be saved

  ● skel feature ~
  ● flux#flux accepts a conf.dir in the place of conf.file ~
  ● var-replace ~
  ● folder expr for non-leaf nodes ~
    ● for example:
      ----------- test.flux -----------
        tab code: lib/*.c
        tab head: lib/*.h
      ---------------------------------
      This should expand to all files inside lib/ folder
      according to the built-in expand() function

  ● synx ~
   ● create syntax for single line multiple statement (endline feature)
     file a,file b,...file n
   ● incorporate synx/nvpm into synx/flux, and leave it just one syntax file
     ● fluxkeyw should be made of only the words in lexis
   ● create autocommands for recognizing flux files
   ● change syntax for : and = in synx

  ● flux#node info field made of multiple ':' splits (make it a list) ~
