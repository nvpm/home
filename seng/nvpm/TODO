  ● save data structure ~
    ● save the contents of the tree, such as: indx,type, etc. 
    ● restore such content after nvpm#edit or at startup
    ● methods such as nvpm#diff, nvpm#quit, and others, may need
      development
  ● nvpm#bind  ~
    ● handles user keyboard mappings 
      Instead of directly mapping, receive bindings as arguments. Say:

      ---- ~/.config/nvim/init.vim ----
                           
                        ...
                           
      call nvpm#bind('n','<space>','loop + 3','silent')
                           
                        ...
                           
      ---------------------------------
  ● nvpm#quit  ~
    ● actions to be done before quiting a neovim session.
      Instead of directly leaving, save DS, current flux file loaded,
      cursor position in each file, line status, and others.
      Such information should be loaded back at startup, by controlled 
      by user variable.

    ● Many other methods may be required

  ● nvpm#diff  ~
    ● Somehow measure the difference between the current DS, and the
      freshly edited current flux file.
      This may be useful to avoid calling flux#flux to much and to use 
      it at startup
  ● develop global flux files and skelletons  ~
    ● needs flux#skel() method first
  ● incorporate g:nvpm.flux into the g:nvpm.tree  ~
    ● This way when changing between flux files using loop,
      only non-loaded flux files will be loaded.
