  ● add a current markers for node ~
    ● if for example a list of files like

    ----------- example.arbo ---------------
      file a.txt
     >file b.txt # will be shown 1st
      file c.txt
      file d.txt
    ----------------------------------------

  ● make arbo remember arbo file structure ~
    ● save comments, block-brackets,tabs, and the
      positions of the blank lines.

      This will provide the tools necessary for a more efficient
      arbo#edit. It would edit the data structure instead of the 
      file itself. Then, on leaving nvim, this DS would be saved

  ● skel feature ~
  ● arbo#arbo accepts a conf.dir in the place of conf.file ~
  ● var-replace ~
  ● folder expr for non-leaf nodes ~
    ● for example:
      ----------- test.arbo -----------
        tab code: lib/*.c
        tab head: lib/*.h
      ---------------------------------
      This should expand to all files inside lib/ folder
      according to the built-in expand() function

  ● arbo#node info field made of multiple ':' splits (make it a list) ~
