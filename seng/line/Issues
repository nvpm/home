  ● zoom mode not updating line numbers in user defined bones { ~
  Mon, october 27, 2025

  In this case, statusline or tabline definitions such as "%m %l,%v/%p%%", 
  which relates to the "user" field in the skeleton variable.

  Such definitions do not update automatically if either lines are placed in 
  the padding buffers g:zoom.pads.{t,b} (top bottom buffers).

  The reason is obvious, such definitions relate to the current buffer being 
  edited. Therefore, the padding buffers will show only their information in 
  their statuslines.

  The solution would be to treat each user definition in the user atom, in 
  the line#atom(...) function, and update the padding lines every time the 
  event CursorMoved hits.

  }
