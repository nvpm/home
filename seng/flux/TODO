  ● flux#loop consider no varname before : ~
    ● Instead of create 'loop <name>: arg1 arg2 ... argn',
      one would create just 'loop arg1 arg2 ... argn'
      and use the values using the wild variable '$_',
      like in the Perl language.
    ● Also, the syntax file should consider this as well

  ● fixt update parent's indx field ~
  ● skel feature ~
  ● var-replace ~
  ● use "=" as absolute path instead of "@", and then remove @ support ~
  ● synx ~
   ● create syntax for single line multiple statement (endline feature)
     file a,file b,...file n
   ● incorporate synx/nvpm into synx/flux, and leave it just one syntax file
     ● fluxkeyw should be made of only the words in lexis
   ● create autocommands for recognizing flux files
  ● flux#node info field made of multiple ':' splits (make it a list) ~
